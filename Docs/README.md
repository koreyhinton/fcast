# Accumulated Info

Components (or entity types) are generated by Entitas as partial class properties to GameEntity class. IE: GameReceiveDamageComponent.cs, GameViewComponent.cs.

GameEntity component properties throw on null checks, so use the corresponding boolean instead:

```csharp
    if (gameEntity.hasReceiveDamage) { // NOT: gameEntity.receiveDamage != null
        // entity is receiveDamage type
    }
    if (gameEntity.hasReceiveDamage && gameEntity.hasView) { // NOT:
                                                      // gameEntity.view != null
        // entity is both receiveDamage and view type
    }
```
